Logistics events are events related to the management and execution of transport and logistics services and document the occurrence of actions, discrepancies, or status changes. These events can be either internal or external to an organization and can include transportation, warehousing, inventory management, supply chain optimization, and other related activities. Examples of logistics events include the departure of an aircraft or the acceptance of shipments in a warehouse.

# Create a Logistics Event

Logistics Events (also known as status updates) in ONE Record can be added to any Logistics Objects 
by sending a HTTP POST request containing a [LogisticsEvent](https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/cargo/3.0.0#LogisticsEvent) object to the `/logistics-events` endpoint of a LogisticsObject.

As for all API interactions, the ONE Record client must be authenticated and have the access rights to perform this action.

As Logistics Events MUST be associated with a specific Logistics Object, creating Logistics Events requires the existence of a Logistics Object. 

## Request

The following HTTP header parameters MUST be present in the request:

| Request Header   | Description                         | Examples            |
| ---------------- |  --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Accept**       | The content type that the ONE Record client wants the HTTP response to be formatted in.        | application/ld+json |
| **Content-Type** | The content type that is contained with the HTTP body. Valid content types. | application/ld+json |

The HTTP request body must contain a valid [LogisticsEvent](https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/cargo/3.0.0#LogisticsEvent) in the format as specified by the Content-Type in the header.

The LogisticsEvent is a data class of the [ONE Record cargo ontology](https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/cargo/3.0).
The properties and relationships to other data classes in visualized in the following class diagram.
