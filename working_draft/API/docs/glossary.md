| ONE Record Server                  | A software program that responses to ONE Record API requests from a ONE Record client on behalf of one or more participants in the Internet of Logistics                      |
| ONE Record Notifications API          | A dedicated ONE Record API endpoint for receiving notifications about updates related to logistics objects.  |
