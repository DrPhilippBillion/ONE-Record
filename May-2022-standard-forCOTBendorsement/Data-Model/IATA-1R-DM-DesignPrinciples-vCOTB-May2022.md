### Introduction
#### 1.1. Purpouse of this document
This document has been produced by the ONE Record Data Model expert group, part of the ONE Record Task Force, under the Cargo Services Conference (CSC) governance. It describes the design principles that have been defined and applied to produce the ONE Record Data Model on conceptual and logical levels.
The design principles are general rules and cargo industry business rules explaining the way the data model has been defined.
Note that this document, especially the concepts and objects in it, may evolve with revised versions of the data model in the future and will include feedbacks from the industry and pilot projects.

#### 1.2. ONE Record
The vision for ONE Record is an end-to-end digital logistics and transport supply chain where data is easily and transparently exchanged in a digital ecosystem of air cargo stakeholders, communities and data platforms. ONE Record is an open standard for data sharing and creates a single record view of the shipment. This standard defines a common data model for the data that is shared via standardized and secured web API. The standard is based on mature but progressive data sharing technologies that are well aligned with the best practices used by leading airlines. This makes it directly accessible to IT teams and service providers.
ONE Record standard aims to become an essential part of the Internet of Logistics (IoL) data exchange infrastructure that is emerging.
An expert group with stakeholders from the whole logistics and transport chain has been gathered to define the ONE Record data model under IATAâ€™s guidance since 2018.

#### 1.3. The ONE Record Data Model
The Data Model is an essential part of ONE Record and aims to provide the air cargo industry with a standard data structure for data exchange using JSON-LD that facilitates data integration with existing and new data services.
Such a data structure needs to be as simple as possible and needs to be shared and understood by any stakeholder involved. This means that the way data objects are defined is applicable to the relationship between a shipper and a forwarder as well as between a forwarder and a carrier.
